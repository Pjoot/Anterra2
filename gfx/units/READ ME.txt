In this folder, Anterra2\gfx\units, you can put DDS files and they'll render on existing base game models. 
It would be easiest to start out with three textures, one for "base" unit, one for "normal" unit, and one for "specular" unit. 
Make sure that your "base" unit texture is labeled with the country and the terrain it's used for. 

Example: Akiteiwa 

AKI_helmet_diff_use

AKI_helmet_normal

AKI_helmet_specular

If you wanted a different texture for snow terrain, you would create a separate DDS file and name it:

AKI_helmet_diff_use_snow
