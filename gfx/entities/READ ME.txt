#.asset files go in here. Any custom units must be placed in here as a .asset file before it can be loaded in.
#.asset files can be edited with Notepad++. You can assign certain animation assets to whatever unit you want.
#Some countries have different animation sets (Ex. Only the US has the repeating rifle animation for their M1 Garand) 
#while Germany has a unique animation for their MP40. You can select which animation sets you want by searching the base game assets.

#You also need a .gfx file here, which basically tells the game that your unit will be using the textures
#located in Anterra2\gfx\models\units. You also need to identify what unique animations you want. 
#*If it is left blank, the unit will use default England animations.
