In this folder, Anterra2\gfx\units, you can put DDS files and they'll render on existing base game models. 
DDS are basically texture files.
In order to create a custom texture, you need the base "diffuse" .dds, "normal" .dds, and "specular" .dds. 
Don't touch specular or normal if you don't know what you're doing.
Make sure that your "base" unit texture is labeled with the country and the terrain it's used for. 

*NOTE* You must have a .asset file as well as object file in Anterra2\gfx\entities for this to work.



Example: Akiteiwa 

AKI_helmet_diff_use

AKI_helmet_normal

AKI_helmet_specular
