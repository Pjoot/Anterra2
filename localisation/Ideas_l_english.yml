 Martin_I_desc:0 "Overlord of Bonamech and Traxí, Duke of Circe, Heleovo and Visia. Also known as 'Martin the Stern', Martin I is the de facto king of Mursland. Assending power in 1922 after his fathers death, his reign has been busy. The 1926 Barxia war with Lusjki was his fireproof, which was greatly won by the Mursian troops. Since then, he has used his anti-communist and nationalist platform to oppress opposition to his political interventions. His scheming has greatly impacted the political landscape in the country; not only did it saw the rise of the MPP and Martinites, but also Katá-Vasiliko which was formed as a direct response to the former."
