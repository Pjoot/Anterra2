 POLITICS_MATTEW_II_DESC:0 "Long gone is the age absolute Monarchist power that was enjoyed by the house of Veislava. For centuries has their great house held the title of the oldest living Monarchy in the history of the world, but that title is soon to be contested from all sides. Mattew is an old man, he has attempted to keep the nation under control for most of his life and it has taken a toll on his body and soul. Despised by the Old Guard for his liberal inclinations, hated by the Communists for his position as a Monarch and under constant pressure by the masses to further liberalize the crippled semi-absolutist monarchy. The future of Mattew is unknown."
