The bomb had been set up to detonate when the office chair would be pulled back. \n\nHowever, it was not Martin who pulled the chair back, but Kaloyan Vaneus, one of the assistants of the Council of State. While Kaloyan was killed instantly by the blast, Martin was only hit by the fragmentation from the desktop. Although no official record has yet been made public, it was reported that between 20 and 65 shards entered the body of the king. \n\nHis condition appears to be highly critical as he was rushed to the hospital. In fact, so critical that various officials have started on preparing the succession process already."
